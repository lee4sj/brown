2. Using "Ant"
    "Ant" is a tool for structuring information about compiling and running
    programs.  For those of you who are familiar with "make"--Ant is similar.  
    We have written a build file such that you need only use a few short
    commands to put your Compiler into action.  These are:
    a.  clean: remove classfiles, to save storage for instance. 
        Example usage:  
        /home/cs031_student/course/cs031/compiler$ ant clean
    
    b.  compile: compile your Java class files into an executable if they have
        changed since your most recent compile.
        Example usage:
        /home/cs031_student/course/cs031/compiler$ ant compile
    
    c.  run: run your compiler.
        Example usage: (parses input.bl and outputs output.mal)
        $ ant run
        If you want to specify the filenames as input and output, do:
        $ ant run -Dblaise=foo.bl -Dmal=bar.s
     
3. Problems
        If you have problems with Ant or your Java configuration, please feel
        free to contact the TA staff.  It makes us feel useful to answer
        questions.
