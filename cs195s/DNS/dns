DNS

question 1:
128.148.36.25



question 2:
CNAME is basically the synonyms in the terminalogy of chapter 4.



question 3:
86400



question 4:
cm: 128.148.10.131
cm.: 195.24.205.60



question 5:
Note that cm is an unqualified domain name and cm. is a qualified domain name. That is, cm is ambiguous and cm. is unambiguous. So, when domain is specified, dns appends the domain to the unqualified name when searching. Thus, the first command actually searchs cm.brown.edu., whereas the second command searchs cm.
