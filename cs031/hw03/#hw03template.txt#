I set it so that S0 = w, S1 = X, S

from W=0, X=0, Y=0, Z=0 through W=1, X=1, Y=1, Z=1
# Use 'x' to denote "don't care"

# Truth table for output 2

# Part c.)
# Minimal SOP expression for output 1
# Express your SOP by using '|' for or, '&' for and, '!' for not, and
# W, X, Y, and Z as your variables
# For example, W & !Z | X & Y & Z | !X

# Minimal SOP expression for output 2



# If you have any questions about the format, please ask a TA!
