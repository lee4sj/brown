Question 1
Because action_id 2 is never committed



Question 2
The studentC and student A should be active. The student A should have 900 and C, 3100.



Question 3
The studentC was not added to DB because the action 3 was not ended, thus not updeated to DB.



Question 4
I expect the state of DB to be
  Account: studentA Value: 900
  Account: studentC Value: 3100
since assuming that wal-sys does roll-forward recovery, it will undo and then redo all the commits and end all active actions.



Question 5
This does match my expectation, since wal-sys actually follows the roll-forward recovery protocol.



Question 6
Loser: actions that were began, but never committed.
Winners: actions that were committed, but not ended.
Done: actions that are ended.



Question 7
checkpoint command does not commit the actions. They only log pending, committed, and done actions.



Question 8
6 lines were rolled back.
The advantage of checkpoint is that the program only needs to roll back up to the check point and then forward scan.



Question 9
Yes, the state of DB is the same. This property is called idempotent.



Question 10
It guarantees the property by ending all "Winner" actions at the recovery phase.
