 * and a pointer to the size of the buffer. The buffer address pointed
 * by str is incremented to point to the null character writen at the
 * end of the new string. The size is decremented by the number of
 * characters writen, not including the null character. The function
 * returns the number of characters left in the buffer (after taking
 * in to account the null character). */
