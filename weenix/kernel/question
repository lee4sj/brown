KERN 1
1. do_waitpid: cancellable sleep?


KERN 2:
1. tty_create: use kmalloc?
   when do we free stuff?

2. tty_global_driver_callback: kfree okay?
   in general what do I do with n_tty_receive_char? kmalloc or use some global structure?

3. ata_write: deal with (const) buf


S5FS:
1. Do directory management differently so that dir->vn_len is the end of the last dirent entry (thus dir do not have any empty dirent (dirent with namelen 0)).



VM:
1. vma->vma_olink ?
2. shadow objs?
3. vmmap_remove, vmmap_map, anything else to do?
