To compile on Mac:

Evan was able to make the code compile after modifying 2 files.
Here we have included the modified version from Evan.

The compiled version is also included in /stencil/bench/source

However, there is still a chance that this compiled version might not work on your Mac.

Please let us know if you have problems with it on a Mac.
