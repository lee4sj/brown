UNISON HANDS ON



METADATA:
        Metadata of a directory is saved at each directory; the metadata is kept per directory that is getting synced with.
        Each line (entry) in the metadata will hold
             1) filename
             2) modification time


Design:
1. I keep a hash table per directories (dir1_ht, dir2_ht) with key=filenames in the directories, and value = modification_time. This hts are used to keep track of newly added files after the check on already existing files is done.

2. I mainly use hash tables to keep track of contents in the directory.

3. General Pipeline:
   1) SETUP phase: interpret metadata, get contents of the directories.
   2) Phase 1: Look through the files recorded in the metadata and resolve differences.
   3) Phase 2:Look through the files NOT recorded in the metadata and resolve differences.

4. The modification times of the files are used to check for updates in the files

5. Metadata is saved as ".unison_[path to directory that cwd is syncing with, "/" replaced by "_"]".

6. The files starting with "." is ignored since by convention those files are metadata.
