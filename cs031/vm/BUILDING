||  BUILDING the VM Project  ||
===============================

Note: these instructions only apply if you are building and running VM
from the command line.  If you're using Eclipse, you do everything through
the GUI.

1. Directories
    -----------------------
    |   dir      contents  |
    -----------------------
        src/     code
        bin/     executables: created by 'ant compile'
        samples/ a collection of sample programs provided by the TAs
                 that might be useful for testing your code

2. Using "Ant"
    "Ant" is a tool for structuring information about compiling programs.
    For those of you who are familiar with "make"--Ant is similar.  
    We have written a build file such that you need only use a few short
    commands to put your VM project into action.  These are:

    a.  clean: remove class files, to save storage for instance. 
        Example usage:  
        
                ant clean
    
    b.  compile: compile your Java class files into an executable if they have
        changed since your most recent compile.
        Example usage:
        
                ant compile

3. Running your VM Project

        To run your VM emulator, run the 'run-vm' script that's provided in
        the top-level directory.

        Example:
                ./run-vm <arguments>
        
        (<arguments> are the command line arguments to your vm.Emulator main
        method.  Consult the handout for the possible command line arguments.

        Example with arguments:
                ./run-vm -lfu life
    
4. Working from home
        If you have copied the VM project to your own computer, be sure to also
        copy the support code from /course/cs031/pub/vm/support.jar.

        Then, you must change the supportjar variables in both 'build.xml' and
        'run-vm' to point to the location on your own computer.  Instructions are
        provided at the top of both those files.

5. Problems
        If you have problems with Ant or your Java configuration, please feel
        free to contact the TA staff.  It makes us feel useful to answer
        questions.
