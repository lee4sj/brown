a) He has to run about 26^8 / 2 possibilities. Since each possibility takes one machine cycle to determine and the machine can run 600 * 10^-3 cycles per second (600 mHz), the project will take (26^8 / 2) / (0.6) = 1.74 * 10^11 seconds.

b) Then it will take (78^8 / 2) / (0.6) = 1.14 * 10^15 seconds.

c) we want (78^8 / 2) / x = (26^8 / 2) / (0.6). Then, x = 3936.6 cycles per second = 3936.6 Hz. Then, we need t such that 0.6 * 3^t = 3936.6: t = 8. Thus 16 years.

This is essentially the same as having one password key. First, the systemwide "password key" must be saved somewhere. Secondly, once a attacker finds the systemwide key, he has access to ALL users. Moreover, if the attacker is a user, then it is vulnerable to brute-force attack. The attacker can try to transform his username using a trial key and see if it matches the presented password; the attacker can brute-force attack in this way.

We need to establish that Louis speaks for Ben.
We know that Jim speaks for Ben.
Then, if Louis speaks for Jim, then Louis speaks for Ben.
Thus, we only need A to establish the truth.
